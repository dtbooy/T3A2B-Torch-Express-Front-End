# R12 Full Stack App - Part A README.md
# R1 	Website Description

## Purpose
Our client, Client X is the proprietor of a shuttle bus company and has secured a grant to provide public shuttle service for the Brisbane 2032 Olympics. Client X has requested the development of a full stack web application which will streamline the process of securing a ticket for a shuttle service. This web application will allow users to view and book shuttle bus tickets to and from various venues across Brisbane, ensuring smooth and efficient transportation throughout the duration of the Olympics.

While traditional methods of booking shuttle bus tickets often involve long queues or phone calls, which can be time-consuming and inconvenient for users, our web application offers a more convenient and efficient way for users to book their tickets, saving them time and effort. Users will be able to access the booking system from anywhere with an internet connection, whether it's from their home, office, or on the go. This accessibility makes it easier for users to plan their transportation needs and book tickets at their convenience. Our web application can provide real-time updates on shuttle bus schedules, availability of seats, and any changes or delays. This ensures that users have accurate information at their fingertips and can make informed decisions when booking their tickets.

Client X has specified that they will be providing services to three main event venues: Brisbane Cricket Ground, Brisbane Arena and Brisbane Football Stadium. They have also specified four locations in Brisbane they will be providing the pick up and drop off services: Eagle Farm, Queen Street Mall Bus Station, Toowong and Southbank. Client X desires a scalable application architecture that seamlessly accommodates the addition of new locations, routes and admin users. This flexibility ensures that the application can efficiently scale to meet evolving business needs, allowing for the effortless integration of additional services as required.


## Functionality / features

### Login and Registration functionality 
Users have the capability to register to the app by using their email address and a secure password. Robust authentication procedures ensure the confidentiality and security of user accounts. Users have the ability to log in to the application using their email and selected password. 
### Search Bar feature
The application features a search bar which allows a user to search for a bus route based on four criteria starting location, end location, date and time. Upon searching the application navigates the user to an information page showing information based on their search criteria.
### Functionality to reserve a ticket 
Users have the ability to reserve a ticket for a selected bus route. They also have the ability to select multiple tickets for a selected route. 
### Navigation Bar feature
The application provides a user friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate across the web pages. It features a navigation bar which allows users to navigate to the home page, their user profile and their reservations.
### Reservations 
The application allows users to view their current reservations for bus routes. It also allows a user to update or delete their current reservations. 
### Locations 
Admin users have the capability to create new locations for pick up and drop off. They also have the ability to update and delete current locations in the application. 
### User Profile
All users have the ability to view their personal information within their profile. This profile allows the user to edit their information as well as delete their account should they wish.



## Target audience
The application is targeted towards members of the general public who will be attending events at the Brisbane 2032 Olympics. The web application is strategically designed to cater to a diverse audience with varying needs and preferences. It is accessible and user friendly for individuals of all backgrounds and abilities. Whether the user is a Brisbane resident, an international visitor, an athlete or an official/volunteer, the web application ensures an intuitive navigation to ensure seamless access to the free shuttle bus service.

# R3 	Application Architecture Diagram
<img src="docs/Images/Architecture Diagram/Architecture.png" alt="Application Architecture Diagram">

Users access the web app through a variety of different devices. Front end / client side renders the views and handles the user interactions. It will request data from the back end through API calls, and dynamically render the webpages based on the API response data. The Back end receives requests from the front end and applies application logic and will send requests to the database. The database receives queries from the backend and returns stores the requested data.

# R4 	User Stories
User stories are a fundamental component of agile software development methodologies, providing a structured approach to understanding and prioritising user needs. We utilised our user stories to help define the scope of the features and functionalities. We decided to do user stories for a standard user and for an admin user - to ensure we covered all aspects of the web application. We found that placing an importance on each story helped us in making informed decisions about what to develop. After developing our dataflow diagrams we went back for a second iteration and refined a few of the user stories, as well as rejected stories that we believed weren't MVP, however these rejected stories will be reconsidered later depending on timeframes. Upon developing the wireframes we then revised the user stories a third time and refined any that needed changes.
